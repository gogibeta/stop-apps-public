/**
 * Pure running-app classification logic.
 *
 * Mirrors the reference app (AppSleep 2.4, method `v2.c.c`, reverse-engineered
 * for interoperability) exactly:
 *
 * 1. Exclusions = own package + default launcher + active keyboard + user
 *    whitelist.
 * 2. The persisted MIUI-invalid set (`mi_invalid_packs`) is read. When it is
 *    nonempty, `last_stopped_time` (default -1L) is read; when that is not
 *    -1L, `UsageStatsManager.queryEvents(lastStopped, now)` collects
 *    packages (any event type counts, first-seen order, only packages with a
 *    launch intent). Invalid packages WITH such events are rehabilitated
 *    (removed from the persisted invalid set); invalid packages WITHOUT
 *    them are added to the exclusions.
 * 3. `PackageManager.getInstalledApplications(0)` is enumerated and a
 *    package counts as running only when: name nonempty, not excluded, not
 *    in the safety list, `ApplicationInfo.enabled`, the `FLAG_STOPPED` bit
 *    clear, and `getLaunchIntentForPackage(pkg) != null` (cached).
 *
 * There is intentionally no usage-recency window: the reference has none,
 * and windowing is what produced the 7-vs-16 count mismatch.
 *
 * This object is pure Kotlin (no Android imports) so it stays JVM-testable;
 * the Android calls live in [AppRepository].
